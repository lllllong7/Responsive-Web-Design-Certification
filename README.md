# Responsive-Web-Design-Certification
The course is divided into several sections, each of which contains a set of challenges and activities that build upon each other. I start by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, then move on to more advanced topics like responsive design, CSS grids, and CSS flexbox.

In order to earining this certification, I finished 5 projects.
